# culling

Hi! My name is `Chris`. You may also know me as `Silly`.

# If you don't know me, you should know that...
### I'm a ghiblicore pinterest girlie desperately trapped in a programmer's body
  - I'm endlessly chasing the sunflower-polaroid, wax-sealed-letters, mushrooms-and-frogs aesthetic
  - You should read the book I wrote and published approximately **in 37 years**
  - If you find the enchanted village in rural Scotland I've been looking for, book me a one-way ticket
  - Teach me crotcheting, carpentry, or pottery. If you're an artisan or artist of any kind please just kidnap meâ€”I'm begging you. I'll bring flowers! And tea!
  - If you're into music, you will not regret asking for my Spotify profile. Endless bangers. There is a playlist for every occasion, and if there isn't there will be
### I'm a bit all or nothing. If I'm in, my obsessive eye for quality knows no bounds
  - This is mostly a bad thing, but there are plenty of ways to exploit this
  - If I show interest, *do* meet me with psychotic amounts of enthusiasm and be ready to take advantage of my ruthless, unending reserve of steaming passion
  - Like a dog, I can be easily tricked into commitment if you just raise the pitch of your voice and increase the rate of speech, carrying it vaguely over positive tonality
### Here are some of my favourite videos, as a treat
Laugh | So Sweet | Wow
